## 🔑 Key Stages

### 1. Data Processing
- Aggregated individual potential savings into a single target variable
- One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables
- Standard Scaling for numerical variables

### 2. Data Exploration (EDA)
- Analyzed feature distributions using histograms, scatter plots, countplots, and correlation heatmaps
- Investigated relationships between features and target variable

### 3. Modeling & Prediction
- Applied **XGBoost** and **Random Forest Regressor**
- Evaluated performance using **MAE, MSE, and R²**
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize accuracy
